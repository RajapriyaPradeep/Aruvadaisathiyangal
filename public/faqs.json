      "title":"AARON—Re Antitype When Blessing.",
      "question": "When Moses and Aaron came out to bless the people, who did Aaron represent?",
      "answer": "I presume that Moses would there stand for and represent God's divine law, blessing the people, and that Aaron was standing for or representing the high priest who had performed the sacrifice. Moses the law-giver stood there as the representative of justice, and the priest who had made the sacrifice stood there to bless also. So Christ will stand as the antitype of Aaron in that picture to bless the world during the thousand years, and right beside him will be the divine law, as represented by Moses. God's whole law and every power of God will be there to bless and put into operation the arrangements that have thus been effected."

      "title":"AARONIC PRIESTHOOD—Should Be Applied Antitypically.",
      "question": "Have we any Scripture to show that the Aaronic priesthood will exercise their priestly office in the Millennial Age?",
      "answer": "One Scripture that might be understood so to teach is found in the book of Malachi, which says that when the Lord shall come into His Temple, 'He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and He shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.'—Mal. 3:3. Some might apply this Scripture to the sons of Levi in a literal way. But we think that it is antitypical, that the Church constitutes the Levitical system and that these are the spiritual Levites whom the Purifier will make ready, that they may offer unto God an acceptable sacrifice, as antitypical Levites and a Royal Priesthood."

      "title":"ACCIDENTS—In Millennium.",
      "question": "Will there be accidents and death during the Millennium aside from those of sinners going into the Second Death?",
      "answer": "While the reign of Christ will be a reign of righteousness unto life, we are not to understand that Adamic death will be at an end as soon as Messiah has begun His reign, for it is stated that He must reign until He has put down all enemies. (1 Cor. 15:25,26.) It is understood that people will be more or less in the Adamic death during the [Page Q6] thousand years and will rise gradually out of Adamic imperfection and death to the perfection of the human nature. We should remember that the Kingdom as it will be established in the beginning of the Millennial Age will consist of the New Jerusalem—that is, the glorified Church, of which Christ is the Head. (Rev. 21:1-8.) During the thousand years the world will be coming into accord with this arrangement. For all such as will come into harmony there will be a blessed arrangement by which they will be protected from any penalty for imperfections. We may reasonably suppose that after perfection is reached there will be no more accidents, just as we have reason to suppose that in heaven there is no necessity for surgeons, doctors, ambulances, etc. 'Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all God's holy mountain (Kingdom).' (Isa. 11:9.) God's will shall be done on earth as it is done in heaven. We read that there shall be no more sighing and no more crying and no more dying."

      "title":"ADAM—The Tree of Life, the Tree of Knowledge.",
        "question":"Did Adam eat of the tree of life before eating of the tree of knowledge? If so, why did he not live forever?",
        "answer":"I answer that the word 'tree of life' is in the plural. All the trees of Eden were trees of life. They were all good for food, beautiful to look upon. They were trees, the eating of which would have maintained the life which God had given to Adam. They were not trees to give some kind of a charm to him, which would hinder him from ever dying. That is not the thought. They were trees of life in the sense that their fruit, partaken of, would have permitted our first parents, if they continued to eat, to live, and would have supplied all of the wastes of their systems so that they would never have needed to die. They had been eating of these trees, so far as our understanding of the Scripture goes, for a little over a year before they were led into temptation by the Adversary and ate of the forbidden kind of trees. We understand this tree of the knowledge of good and evil was not one tree, but one kind of trees, and of that particular kind of trees, they were not to eat. And when God, therefore, would have them die, He drove them out of the garden, away from the trees of life, and into the unprepared earth, where they must till the ground and battle with the thorns and thistles, until they were to return to this earth from whence taken. The penalty was death and the intimation is that if the Lord had allowed them to remain in Eden, they would not have come into a dying condition, but would have remained in full vigor and strength of their human nature, notwithstanding their being sinners."

        "question":"If Adam has had a trial and failed, will he have another and if so, what for? Why should he be resurrected if he failed in the first trial?",
        "answer":"The reason that he is to have a resurrection and another trial is because God willed it so, and that is the very best reason. Now, if you want to know why, we may do some guessing, perhaps, to our advantage.I think the reason God willed it so is that in some respects Adam did not have a trial under the most favorable conditions that God could have arranged, although his trial was a just trial. He was fully equipped mentally, [Page Q7] but a great temptation came to him, and because of the lack of experience he failed. AWhat was the trial or temptation?"

      "title":"BABYLON—Re River Euphrates.",
      "question": "Literal Babylon was built on the literal Euphrates river, while mystic Babylon sits on the mystic Euphrates. Then what is the mystic river?",
      "answer": "We are going to have a sermon on that very subject before long, and you will get the answer there, perhaps. But just briefly I will say the mystic Euphrates would represent people according to the explanation given us in the Scripture. Thus the waters upon which the woman sitteth are peoples and nations and tongues, and the turning away of the waters of the mystic Euphrates from the antitypical Babylon, or from the mystical Babylon, would signify the turning of the people away. And they are turning away a good deal now, according to what we read in the newspapers. Very small congregations are to be had everywhere. By the way, about three weeks ago when I was in Boston, the assistant editor of the Boston Congregationalist came to me on Monday after our sermon on Sunday and said, 'Pastor Russell, may I ask you a question.' Yes.'I am assistant editor of the Congregationalist, and I was out on Sunday at the Boston theater, and it was a hot day, and as I looked over that audience and saw four thousand people there under that roof on a hot day and sitting for that length of time, I began to wonder why it is that our largest churches in Boston here, and our most eloquent preachers, and finely paid choirs, only have from twenty to forty or fifty to seventy at a meeting. How is it? Will you tell me what you say about it?' I said, 'I think, my friend, that the Bible explains that by saying there was a famine in the land—not a famine for bread or for water, but a famine, saith the Lord, for the hearing of the Word of the Lord.' I said, 'I think those people wanted to hear something about the Word of the Lord."

      "title":"BACK SLIDERS—With What Greeting?",
      "question": "How should we greet those who have left the class and call us worse than Babylon? Shall we give them a hearty greeting when they come to our meetings?",
      "answer": "I think not, why should you? I am going to be specially hearty to those who are specially like my dear Redeemer, marked with the character likeness of my Redeemer. I would not be so hearty with those who have left the class, just to let them see that there is a difference, otherwise they might think they were better than those in the class; because they had become obstreperous in some way. They should be greeted according to the Apostle's words, 'Mark those who cause divisions and offenses.' Mark those who are tending toward division, and don't make them your bosom companions, don't elect them as elders, etc., for that is just the wrong thing. Don't encourage anybody who has a strifeful condition. Lay him on the shelf and let him have strife to himself. Let us be careful that we do not cultivate anything in our own hearts, of their spirit. Let us be gentle, but firm. If any such should approach me, I would shake hands with him. I would not say, No, I will not shake hands with you. But I would not make of them my bosom companions. We want to remember what they said of the Apostles in the early church, 'They took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.' We want to make our bosom companion our Lord Jesus. We want to be with Jesus, and those who have most of His character likeness will be most like Him. They are all those who have the spirit of Christ. He spent more of His time and chose those who should be near Him from among those who had most of [Page Q31] His spirit, Peter, James and John. These three were with Him on the Mount of Transfiguration, and they were nearest Him in the garden of Gethsemane. Counsel with those who have the spirit of the Lord."

      "question": "Some one has asked why we baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, if the Holy Spirit is not a person?",
      "answer": "First, that is the formula given in the Scriptures, and secondly, because it is the right thought. We do not baptize in our own name, or in the name of the Baptist Church, or in the name of some other church. But what authority do we recognize? Do we recognize the Father's authority and sanction to baptize? Yes, indeed. Do we recognize the Son's authority and sanction to baptism? Yes, indeed. Do we recognize that the Spirit sanctions this matter of baptism? Yes, indeed. Well, then, we perform the baptism in the name of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, as representing that which is the will of God, and in every sense the spirit of the Lord's will and teaching. The thought is, the matter of baptism is approved by the Lord Jesus, approved by the Heavenly Father, and approved by the spirit of holiness, the spirit of God, the spirit of the truth."

        "question":"When there were no other inhabitants of the earth but Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, into what country did Cain and Abel go to take unto themselves wives, there being but four people (the above named) upon the earth, according to Scripture?",
        "answer":"The Scriptures do not say there were no more than four people upon the earth. The Scriptures do not mention the daughters of Adam, and the supposition would be in harmony with the record, that when Cain took a wife, he took one of his sisters. There was no objection to a brother and sister marrying then, for in many respects they would be better adapted. The reason for their not marrying today is that the race has so deteriorated that for a brother and sister to marry, their children would inherit the characteristics of the family to such an extent that they would go insane, and therefore the law forbids it, even to cousins and second cousins.This is quite a contradiction, you see, to the doctrine of evolution."

      "title":"CAMP—How Many Camps.",
        "question":"'Together with Him without the camp'—does this mean to go out in the second camp, or are there two camps?",
        "answer":"The Apostle says, Let us go to Him without the camp. In the English of today we would say, Let us go to Him outside the camp. We do not use the word 'without' the camp in that same way today. Let us go to Him outside the camp—what does that mean? Well the camp would represent that condition of things which claimed to be in harmony with God. Look back in Jesus' day: Jesus went outside the camp. Was it the Gentile camp? No. What was the camp with Him? The camp in Jesus' time was composed of all those who professed to be God's people, holy people—all the Jewish people who professed to be in harmony with the Lord. What would it mean that He went outside the camp? He was pledged in his faithfulness and loyalty to God to take His stand which took Him outside of the sympathy and fellowship of those who were not fully Israelites indeed—all the Jews that were Israelites indeed in whom was no guile could appreciate it, and they, like the disciples, were in the attitude of the Levites that were approaching the Holy and drawing near to the Lord, and were, like the Levites, ministering in the Court. This would represent the attitude of all believers inside of that white curtain. But those who constituted the camp at that time were nominal professors who did not appreciate fully, and Jesus in order to be faithful to God and His message was obliged to stand for the truth, for that which is right, and that brought Him out of sympathy and out of accord with the great nominal mass of the Jewish people. Now the Apostle says, Let us go to Him outside the camp. What does this mean? It meant to the Apostles of old that they should also take the same stand toward the law that Jesus took toward the law; the same stand toward the Pharisees and scribes and the [Page Q47] doctors of the law that Jesus took. Then to those afterwards who became associated with the Gentiles, as, for instance Paul, Silas, and Barnabas, who ministered to the Gentiles, we think outside the camp meant outside the synagogue of the Jews and all of those who professed to be in harmony with God that were living in Rome, or wherever they might be—whoever stood for and claimed to be God's people constituted the camp. What does it mean today? The camp today means all of Christendom, all the dear people who claim that they are spiritual Israelites, that is God's camp. It is found principally in the United States and Europe. And all of God's people who are sincerely following in the footsteps of Jesus will find that they will not be appreciated by the general camp. In other words, the nominal church will not generally appreciate the spirit of the Lord and the teachings of the Lord, and therefore all who would be faithful to Jesus and walk in his steps will find themselves today just as much out of accord with the camp of today as Jesus and the Apostles found themselves out of accord with the camp of their day. To go to Him without the camp today means that we will take up our cross, whatever sacrifice it might mean to you and me, the breaking of tender ties with dear fellow Christians who are Methodists, or Presbyterians, etc., willing to go to the Lord and be faithful and loyal to Him at any cost, no matter how others may view it. And as a matter of fact it was those of the camp that persecuted Jesus and the Apostles; and it is those of the camp who have persecuted the Church which is the Body of Christ from that day to this."
